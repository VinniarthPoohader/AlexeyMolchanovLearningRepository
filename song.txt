Here our soldiers stand
From all around the world waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry all are gathered here
Victory is near the sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right, to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry stand and fight together
Beneath the metal sky brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Something something
We're warriors, warriors of the world
